# Cloning

This repository contains submodules, this means you should clone recursively in order to clone everything. To do that you can use `git clone --recursive https://github.com/<your-username>/gipAndroid` command.
If you already cloned without recursive flag, you can also use `git submodule update --init --recursive` command.
